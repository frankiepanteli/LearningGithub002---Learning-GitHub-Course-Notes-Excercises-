# LearningGithub002
This repository contains part of my work from the LinkedIn Learning course "Learning GitHub." This was a video course with excercises covering GitHub fundamentals. More information about the contents of this can be found in my notes (CourseNotes_Learning GitHub.txt), a copy of which is found in each of three separate repos where the course excercises have been completed (LearningGithub001, LearningGithub002 and LearningGithub003). LearningGithub002 contains an excercise on using actions in GitHub.
